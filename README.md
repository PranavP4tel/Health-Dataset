# Health-Dataset
Explored data containing absenteeism, compensation and absence reason information, and evaluated several factors and derived insights from the same.

Worked in SQL to assess:
1. List of healthy individuals with low absenteeism
2. Calculate wage increase for non smokers for insurance budget of 983,221
3. Asbenteeism in seasons. (Inspected season with peak absenteeism)
4. Distribution of reason for absence
5. Absenteeism based on age ranges
6. Distribution of disciplinary failure with age
7. Total transportation expense
8. Correlation between transportation expense and commute distance

Imported the data from MySQL Server to PowerBI and evaluated:
1. Average absenteeism for employees
2. Segregation of employees based on Body Mass Index(BMI), involved in social drinking and social smoking, and age
3. Absenteeism across seasons, months, days of the week, & as per age distribution and produced inferences from the same
4. Distribution of reason for absenteeism
5. Created slicers based on social drinking, smoking and BMI category for a granular evaluation
